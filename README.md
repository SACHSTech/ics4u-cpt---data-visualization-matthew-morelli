# ICS4U - CPT: Data Interaction and Visualization

## Description of Dataset
The data set I am using shows the top 200 universities in the world.  It has the global ranking, the university name,
the country, teaching, international, research, citations, income, total score, number of students, student staff ratio,
and international students.

## Why I selected this data set
I selected this data set because since I've been applying to universities, I thought it would be interesting to choose
data based on univerisities.  It has interesting information and the data is something I am willing to work with and is not boring to me.  It also had a sufficient amount of columns for me to work with, which worked out as well.
